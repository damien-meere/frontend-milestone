# Damien Meere - BT Ireland
User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project - Code Institute 

This project website will highlight my capability to employ the various tools illustrated through out the User-centric frontend development section of the Code Institute programme. This site will be a mock-up of a training company site. This will house information from three different strands of training - Technical, Management and Soft-Skills training.

## Demo
A live demo can be found here - <!--Include link to deployed Github pages-->

<!--Need to create a site demo gif to illustrate the front page of the site scrolling-->

## UX
The goal in developing this site to to make it easy for training candidates to access information on available training options, through a minimalist, sleek, easy to navigate site. This site is built to provide this capability regardless of the devices utilised to access the site.

I want to provide a brief beakdown of the areas of training that this company offer on the home page, 

A link to my social media (i.e. LinkedIn profile, GitHub, twitter etc.) are also provided to illustrate this functionality. I've not built social media profiles for my training company, so I've used my personal accounts to demonstrate this functionality.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)

## Current Features
This site uses the JSFiddle script to enable the alteration of booking modals, depending on the chosen programme.

## Future Features 
In future I would like to link the the booking form illustrating course availability progress bars to a working database in order to give training candidates a live view of available space ont the coure.

## Testing
All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"'.  All links have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination.

## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page is named `index.html`.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/damien-meere/frontend-milestone.git` into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.
